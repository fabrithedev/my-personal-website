I am very close to turning 42. My generation grew up during the rise of video game consoles in Brazil.

As a kid, it was the 8-bit consoles: NES and Master System. As a pre-teen, the 16-bit era: SNES and Mega Drive. In my early teens, the amazing 32-bit world of the PlayStation and the 64-bit world of the Nintendo 64.

Like most boys my age, I dreamed of making games. And like the vast majority, I abandoned this dream when I had to deal with the obligations of adult life.

The first years of my adult life were marked by a lot of work and little money. Fortunately, time passed and things stabilized. I had a slightly better salary, a stable career, and less demanding work. That’s when I finally had more time to think about what I really wanted to do — not work, but hobbies. I asked myself repeatedly:

What do I want to do with the little time I have outside of adult responsibilities?

**Video games. That was the answer most of the time.**

# When Being an Adult Gets in the Way

At first, I approached this the wrong way. Like many adults, the first thing I thought about was how to make money from it. I did some research and realized that it’s easier to win the lottery than to make money as an indie developer. So, for a while, I ignored the idea.

We grow up thinking this way. When you come from a humble background, you quickly learn that being an adult means leaving childhood dreams behind. It’s time to go into survival mode. Nothing is free and everything is expensive. Every action and every second must be spent improving your life.

This mindset kept me from enjoying the hobby I had always wanted. With every attempt, I sabotaged myself because I was already thinking about the financial outcome. “If it’s not going to make money, it’s a waste of time.” “I could be doing something more productive.” These were the thoughts that held me back. I even started to doubt whether I truly liked it.

# When Being an Adult Helps

As the years passed, I became more mature. We make many mistakes over time, but every now and then we gain a bit of wisdom too. Maturity helped me understand that I had been approaching this from the wrong angle. Creating games can be a hobby; it doesn’t need to be profitable. I already have a job and a career. Making games can simply be something I invest time and money in for fun. And that’s when things started to fall into place.

I didn’t make a big plan. Gradually, I started taking small steps. It happened naturally; there was no specific turning point. I began reading and studying more. I signed up for a few courses. When I had some money left over, I upgraded my computer and bought a drawing tablet and some books. One thing led to another, slowly and without pressure.

It's been about four years now, and I want to write down six small reflections from this period so that, in moments of doubt, I can revisit them and regain my motivation.

## 1. This Is a Hobby, Not a Job

This is a hobby. Don’t pressure yourself or expect financial results. If you treat it like a second job, it will quickly stop being fun. If one day it becomes your profession, great! But remember that very few people reach that point.

## 2. Consistency Is Better Than Intensity

An adult with a full-time job has little free time for a hobby. To become good at something, you need time to study and practice. So focus on doing one small thing every day. Read something. Watch a lesson. Run a small experiment. Just keep going.

## 3. Invest in Your Hobby

When you have some money left over, buy something that makes your hobby more enjoyable — and don’t feel guilty about it. It could be a new monitor, a graphics card, or a book. Anything that makes the process more fun.

## 4. Find People Who Share the Same Interest

One of the best parts of having a hobby is meeting people who share your interests. They are not your competitors. They are your allies. Look for communities and other developers to exchange experiences and ideas.

## 5. The Process Matters More Than the Result

Focus on the process, not the outcome. Creating a game that people enjoy is wonderful, but the act of creating it has to be even more enjoyable for it to truly be worthwhile.

## 6. You Are in Control

It is completely normal to have abandoned or unfinished projects. The only thing that matters is whether you’re having fun. This is a hobby, and the main goal is enjoyment. Don’t let anyone else define that for you.
